Scope
=====

The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics
Program, including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and
Job-to-Job Flows (J2J), are available for download according to
[structural](lehd_public_use_schema.md) and [file
naming](lehd_csv_naming.md) schema. The data themselves are available as
Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD website’s Data page
at <http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/> as well as through the [LED
Extraction Tool](http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/).

Shapefiles are used to provide mapping functionality in [QWI
Explorer](http://qwiexplorer.ces.census.gov/) and [Job-to-Job Explorer
(Beta)](https://j2jexplorer.ces.census.gov/). They are created by
transforming input shapefiles sourced from
[TIGER/Line](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html).
New TIGER/Line shapefiles are typically released by the Census Bureau’s
Geography Division in August of each year, which are then processed by
the LEHD program as new tabulation areas for the
QWI\[<http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#qwi>\] and
J2J\[<http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#j2j>\] data products. The LEHD
shapefiles will be made available in the data schema in coordination
with the public release of QWI and J2J data products, usually in
November or December of each year.

Sources
=======

Files are derived from  [TIGER/Line 2017
shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html):

-   [tl\_2017\_us\_state](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2017/STATE/)

-   [tl\_2017\_us\_county](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2017/COUNTY/)

-   [tl\_2017\_us\_cbsa](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2017/CBSA/)

-   [tl\_2017\_(ST)\_place](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2017/PLACE/)
    (for creation of WIA/WIB shapefile)

-   [tl\_2017\_(ST)\_cousub](http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2017/COUSUB/)
    (for creation of WIA/WIB shapefile)

Transformations
===============

The following major transformations are applied to the input files:

-   All geographies are reprojected to [WGS-1984 Geographic Coordinate
    System](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/)

-   Shoreline water has been clipped out to provide a more recognizable
    depiction of the coastlines.

-   Each layer is given internal point coordinates (stored as double)
    based on the WGS-1984 projection (decimal degrees).

-   Each layer is run through a "simplify polygon" procedure to remove
    unnecessary complexity from the features.

-   Features from Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands
    have been removed because they are not used in current LEHD
    tabulations.

-   Each shapefile’s attribute table has been updated to conform to the
    standard LEHD output format, defined in [Format](#format) section

Outputs
=======

Output shapefiles – grouped by paired products – are listed below. Each
shapefile includes specific notes on its preparation.

Basic Naming Schema
===================

All files follow the following naming convention:

    [type]]_[geocat].zip

where \[type\] = lehd\_shp and [geocat](naming_geocat.csv) contains

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="20%" />
<col width="80%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

Files are distributed as [ESRI
Shapefiles](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000280.shtml),
packaged as [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format))
files. The SHP component of these archives is described here. Other
components (dbf, prj, shx) files are not documented here, we refer users
to <http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000280.shtml> .

Values
------

### STUSPS

( [label\_stusps.csv](label_stusps.csv) )

FIPS State Postal Code as per
<https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html>

### GEOGRAPHY

( [label\_geography.csv](label_geography.csv) ) The valid codes
correspond to those listed on
[label\_geography.csv](label_geography.csv) and
[label\_geography\_metro.csv](label_geography_metro.csv).

### NAME

This is a string that corresponds in general to the *label* field on
[label\_geography.csv](label_geography.csv) and
[label\_geography\_metro.csv](label_geography_metro.csv). Minor
deviations for ease of exposition are possible.

Common files
------------

### State

( [lehd\_shp\_gs.zip](lehd_shp_gs.zip) )

No transformations occur to this layer other than those listed above.

QWI Geographies
---------------

### County

( [lehd\_shp\_gc.zip](lehd_shp_gc.zip) )

-   STUSPS is appended to the NAME field so that county names are
    nationally unique. Example: "Cook, IL"

### CBSA - within State

( [lehd\_shp\_gm.zip](lehd_shp_gm.zip) )

-   All features are split into state-specific CBSA features by
    intersecting each feature with the state shapefile features.

-   The STUSPS field is added during the intersect with the state
    shapefile.

-   STFIPS (i.e. FIPS State Code as per
    <https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi_statetables.html>) is
    prepended to the CBSA code
    (<https://www.census.gov/population/metro/data/def.html>) to create
    the GEOGRAPHY field to distinguish state-parts of the same CBSA
    (i.e. make them nationally unique).

-   The text "(\[STUSPS\] part)" is appended to the NAME field only for
    those CBSA features that are split by state lines.

### Workforce Investment Board Areas

( [lehd\_shp\_gw.zip](lehd_shp_gw.zip) )

The WIA/WIB shapefiles are built from the Place, County Subdivision, and
County shapefiles from TIGER/Line based on definitions provided by the
LED state partners.

Job-to-Job Flow Geographies
---------------------------

### Metropolitan (complete)

( [lehd\_shp\_gb.zip](lehd_shp_gb.zip) )

-   Micropolitan areas are removed and state remainder areas are added
    as new features. State remainders are assigned unique codes
    (\[STUSPS\]+999) and names ("Not in metropolitan area, \[STUSPS\]").

Versioning
==========

Versioning rules follow [Semantic Versioning
