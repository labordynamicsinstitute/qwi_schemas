            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber

***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available as Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data
page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through LED Extraction Tool at
http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the file naming schema for LEHD-provided CSV files.
***** 2. Schema for Data File Contents *****
The contents (schema) for LEHD data files are described in
lehd_public_use_schema.html. The contents (schema) for shapefiles are described
in lehd_shapefiles.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This version reimplements some features from V4.0. Many files compliant with
LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but
compatibility is not guaranteed.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
This version supersedes V4.1, for files released as of R2018Q1
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
All files are preceded by a file type definition, followed by additional
information on the aggregation level of the file, or some other identifier.

**** 5.1. QWIPU from the LED Extraction Tool ****
Files downloaded through the LED Extraction Tool at http://
ledextract.ces.census.gov/ follow the following naming convention:
[type]_[id].[EXT]
where [id] is the Request ID (a unique string of characters) generated every
time Submit Request'' is clicked. The ID references each query submission made
to the database.
5.2. Metadata for QWI data files (version.txt)
Metadata accompanies the data files, identifying provenance, geographic and
temporal coverage. These files follow the following naming convention:
version_[demo]_[fas].txt
where each name component is described in more detail below.
5.3. Metadata for J2J data files (version.txt)
Metadata accompanies the data files, identifying provenance, geographic and
temporal coverage. These files follow the following naming convention:
version_[type].txt
where each name component is described in more detail below.
5.4. Metadata for J2JOD files
Because the origin-destination (J2JOD) data link two regions, we provide an
auxiliary file with the time range for which cells containing data for each
geographic pairing may appear in a data release. The reference region will
always be either the origin or the destination. These files follow the
following naming convention:
j2jod_[geography]_avail.csv
where each name component is described in more detail below.
