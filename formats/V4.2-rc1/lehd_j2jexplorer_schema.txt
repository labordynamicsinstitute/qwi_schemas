***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) data provided by the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics Program are accessible through the J2J_Explorer_
(beta). This document provides information on the schema used to format files
downloaded through that application.
***** 2. Additional information *****
The complete LEHD schema is documented in lehd_public_use_schema.html. LEHD-
provided SHP files are separately described in lehd_shapefiles.html. The naming
conventions of the data files is documented in lehd_csv_naming.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This is the first version of the schema for the J2J Explorer (beta)
application.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
No prior version.
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain
[identifiers], subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status
flags.
**** 5.1. Generic structure ****
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ … ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ … ]
Note: The J2J Explorer (beta) provides the full set of J2J indicators in
addition to two composite Origin-Destination indicators. Files downloadable
through other means may be structured differently, please consult the complete
LEHD schema in lehd_public_use_schema.html.
5.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.

5.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the
CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
applications. When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related
documentation and articles. The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication
or data quality status (see Status_Flags). The 'Indicator Name' is a more
verbose name for the indicator. The 'Description' provides a complete
description of the indicator. 'Units' identify the type of variable: counts,
rates, monetary amounts. 'Concept' classifies each indicator in a descriptive
category: employment, hire, separation, earnings, or flow. The 'Base' indicates
the denominator used to compute the statistic, and may be 1.

**** 6.16. Aggregation level ****
( label_agg_level.csv )
Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different
dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and
other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables,
characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.
Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by
the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level
grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different
combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave
space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.
agg_level is currently reported only for J2J data products.
The following variables are included in the label_agg_level.csv file:
Variable       Description
agg_level      index representing level of aggregation reported on a given
               record
worker_char    demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record
firm_char      firm characteristics reported on record. These will be the
               characteristics of the destination firm in O-D tabulations
firm_orig_char characteristics of origin firm reported on record (O-
               D tabulations only)
j2j            Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J counts tables
j2jr           Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J rates tables
j2jod          Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J O-D tables
qwi            Flag: Aggregation level available on QWI
The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a
series of flags following the standard schema:
    * geo_level - geographic level of table
    * ind_level - industry level of table
    * by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including
      ownership, demographics, firm age and size.
A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is
available in the link above.

7. Status flags
( label_flags.csv )
Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
            Important
[Important] Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags -1, 1, 5.
            Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online
            applications, not in CSV files.
flag label
 -2  no data available in this category for this quarter
 -1  data not available to compute this estimate
  1  OK
  5  Value suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication
     standards.
  6  Value calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion
  7  Value calculated from other released measures - some of which have
     significantly distorted data
  9  Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released
 10  Aggregate of cells - no significant distortion
 11  Aggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S.
     Census Bureau publication standards
 12  Aggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data
8. Metadata
( variables_version.csv )
8.1. Version Metadata for J2J Files (version.txt)
Each data release is accompanied by one or more files with metadata on
geographic and temporal coverage, in a compact notation. These files follow the
following naming convention:
version_[type].txt
where each component is described in more detail in lehd_csv_naming.html.
The contents contains the following elements:
Component Source            Description
product   [type]            Type as described in lehd_csv_naming.html
demo_fas  [demo]_[fas]      (optional - concatenated with product) used for QWI
                            to distinguish separate tabulations from the legal
                            [demo]_[fas] combinations as described in
                            lehd_csv_naming.html
geo       [stusps] or METRO Covered [geography] (uppercase state postal code
                            including entire nation or the word METRO)
geonum    [geography]       Numeric geography code
start     yyyy:q            Start year and quarter
end       yyyy:q            End year and quarter
schema    Vx.y.z            Version of the schema
release   RyyyyQq           Release quarter (identifies when the data was
                            created)
internal  various           Internal identifier used for provenance tracking
For instance, the metadata for the R2017Q3 release of Missouri J2J tabulations
(obtained from here) has the following content:
J2J MO 29 2000:2-2016:3 V4.2b-draft R2017Q3 j2jpu_mo_20171023_1412
Some J2J metadata may contain multiple lines, as necessary.
8.2. Additional Metadata for J2JOD Files (avail.csv)
(variables_avail.csv)
Because the origin-destination (J2JOD) data link two regions, we provide an
auxiliary file with the time range that cells containing data for each
geographic pairing may appear in a data release.
variable       type    label
geo_level      Char(1) Geographic level of destination region
geography      Char(8) Geography code of destination region
geo_level_orig Char(1) Geographic level of origin region
geography_orig Char(8) Geography code of origin region
start_year     Num     First year regional pair may be observed
start_quarter  Num     First quarter regional pair may be observed
end_year       Num     Last year regional pair may be observed
end_quarter    Num     Last quarter regional pair may be observed
The reference region will always be either the origin or the destination.
National tabulations contain records where both origin and destination are
geo_level=N; state tabulations contain records where geo_level in (N,S); metro
tabulations contain records where geo_level in (N,S,B). Data may be suppressed
for certain combinations of regions and quarters because the estimates do not
meet Census Bureau publication standards.
8.3. Metadata on Indicator Availability
(variables_lags.csv)
Each Indicator potentially requires leads and/or lags of data to be computed,
and thus may not be available for certain time periods. The date range for J2J
and J2JR can be found in version.txt; the date range for J2JOD can be found in
avail.csv.
For each indicator, the following files contain the quarters of data required
to be available relative to the overall date range described in the metadata
for the release:
    * lags_j2j.csv
    * lags_j2japp.csv
The files are structured as follows:
variable                     type label
Indicator Variable           Num  Name of the Indicator
Quarters_Required_Prior      Num  Number of quarters of data required to
                                  compute indicator relative to start quarter
Quarters_Required_Subsequent Num  Number of quarters of data required to
                                  compute indicator relative to end quarter
