            Important
            This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is
[Important] compiled from publicly accessible information by Lars Vilhuber
            (Labor_Dynamics_Institute,_Cornell_University). Feedback is
            welcome. Please write us at lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu.
***** 1. Purpose *****
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program,
including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J),
are available for download with the following data schema. These data are
available through the LEHD website’s Data page at http://lehd.ces.census.gov/
data/ and through the LED Extraction Tool at http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.
This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. LEHD-provided SHP files
are separately described in lehd_shapefiles.html. For each variable, a set of
allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files, with header
variable definitions. Changes relative to the original v4.0 version are listed
at_the_end.
***** 2. File naming *****
The naming conventions of the data files is documented in lehd_csv_naming.html.
***** 3. Extends *****
This version reimplements some features from V4.0. Many files compliant with
LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but
compatibility is not guaranteed.
***** 4. Supersedes *****
This version supersedes V4.1.0, for files released as of R2017Q1.
***** 5. Basic Schema *****
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain
[identifiers], subsequent columns contain [indicators], followed by status
flags. In some cases, visually formatted Excel (XLSX) files are also available,
containing the same information together with header lines on each sheet.
**** 5.1. Generic structure ****
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ … ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ … ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ … ]
Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the
Indicators section. While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only
the requested indicators will be included in data outputs from the LED
Extraction Tool.
5.2. Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record
identifiers are noted below, by file type. Identifiers without the year and
quarter component can be considered a series identifier.
*** 5.2.1. Mapping for Identifiers ***
( lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv )
Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records
(Identifiers). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications to
the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each
set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list
of values, documented in the section on Categorical_Variables.

5.3. Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files list the indicators available
on each file. The descriptor files themselves are structured as follows:
    * The 'Indicator Variable' is the short name of the variable on the CSV
      files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical
      applications.
    * When given, the 'Alternate name' may appear in related documentation and
      articles.
    * The 'Status Flag' is used to indicate publication or data quality status
      (see Status_Flags).
    * The 'Indicator Name' is a non-abbreviated version of the 'Indicator
      Variable'.
    * The 'Description' provides more verbose description of the variable.
    * 'Units' identify the type of variable according to a very simplified
      taxonomoy (not formalized yet): counts, rates, monetary amounts.
    * 'Concept' classifies the variables into higher-level concepts. The
      taxonomy for these concepts has not been finalized yet, see
      label_concept_draft.csv for a draft version.
    * The 'Base' indicates the denominator used to compute the statistic, and
      may be 1.

5.4. Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files list the variability measures
available on each file. The 'Variability Measure' is the short name of the
variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of
statistical applications. When given, the 'Alternate Name' may appear in
related documentation and articles. The 'Variable Name' is a more verbose
description of the variability measure.
Six variability measures are published:
    * Total variability, prefixed by vt_
    * Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total
      Variability
    * Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
    * Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
    * Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
    * Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_
A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding
indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

6.13. Geography
6.13.1.  Geographic levels
Geography labels for data files are provided in separate files, by scope. Each
file label_geograpy_SCOPE.csv may contain one or more types of records as
flagged by geo_level. For convenience, a composite file containing all geocodes
is available as label_geography.csv. The 2017 vintage of Census_TIGER/Line
geography is used for all tabulations as of the R2018Q1 release.
Shapefiles are described in a separate_document.

**** 6.14. Aggregation level ****
( label_agg_level.csv )
Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different
dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and
other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables,
characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.
Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by
the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level
grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different
combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave
space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.
agg_level is currently reported only for J2J data products.
The following variables are included in the label_agg_level.csv file:
Variable       Description
agg_level      index representing level of aggregation reported on a given
               record
worker_char    demographic (worker) characteristics reported on record
firm_char      firm characteristics reported on record. These will be the
               characteristics of the destination firm in O-D tabulations
firm_orig_char characteristics of origin firm reported on record (O-
               D tabulations only)
j2j            Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J counts tables
j2jr           Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J rates tables
j2jod          Flag: Aggregation level available on J2J O-D tables
qwi            Flag: Aggregation level available on QWI
The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a
series of flags following the standard schema:
    * geo_level - geographic level of table
    * ind_level - industry level of table
    * by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including
      ownership, demographics, firm age and size.

available in the link above.

Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid
values. The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.
            Important
[Important] Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags -1, 1, 5.
            Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online
            applications, not in CSV files.

Similarly, the metadata for the R2017Q3 release of Missouri J2J tabulations
(obtained from here) has the following content:
J2J MO 29 2000:2-2016:3 V4.2b-draft R2017Q3 j2jpu_mo_20171023_1412
Some J2J metadata may contain multiple lines, as necessary.
8.2. Additional Metadata for J2JOD Files (avail.csv)
(variables_avail.csv)
Because the origin-destination (J2JOD) data link two regions, we provide an
auxiliary file with the time range that cells containing data for each
geographic pairing may appear in a data release.
variable       type    label
geo_level      Char(1) Geographic level of destination region
geography      Char(8) Geography code of destination region
geo_level_orig Char(1) Geographic level of origin region
geography_orig Char(8) Geography code of origin region
start_year     Num     First year regional pair may be observed
start_quarter  Num     First quarter regional pair may be observed
end_year       Num     Last year regional pair may be observed
end_quarter    Num     Last quarter regional pair may be observed
The reference region will always be either the origin or the destination.
National tabulations contain records where both origin and destination are
geo_level=N; state tabulations contain records where geo_level in (N,S); metro
tabulations contain records where geo_level in (N,S,B). Data may be suppressed
for certain combinations of regions and quarters because the estimates do not
meet Census Bureau publication standards.
8.3. Metadata on Indicator Availability
(variables_lags.csv)
Each Indicator potentially requires leads and/or lags of data to be computed,
and thus may not be available for certain time periods. Only two QWI will be
available for all quarters of the time span described by start and end in the
version.txt files: EmpTotal and Payroll. The date range for QWI, QWIR, J2J, and
J2JR can be found in version.txt; the date range for J2JOD can be found in
avail.csv.
For each indicator, the following files contain the quarters of data required
to be available relative to the overall date range described in the metadata
for the release:
    * lags_qwi.csv
    * lags_j2j.csv
    * lags_j2japp.csv
The files are structured as follows:
variable                     type label
Indicator Variable           Num  Name of the Indicator
Quarters_Required_Prior      Num  Number of quarters of data required to
                                  compute indicator relative to start quarter
Quarters_Required_Subsequent Num  Number of quarters of data required to
                                  compute indicator relative to end quarter
9.  Changes
For a description of how schema files are versioned, see main_directory.
**** 9.1. This version (revisions) ****
    * 2017-12-15: Initial release
**** 9.2. Version 4.2.0 from 4.1.3 ****
    * Updated industry classification from NAICS 2012 to NAICS 2017
    * Added J2J Explorer-specific description of metadata for convenience
      (lehd_j2jexplorer_schema.html)
    * Added a column ind_level to label_industry.csv similar to the geo_level
    * Added additional columns to the variable metadata schema for greater
      clarity
          o Description,
          o Concept,
          o Base
    * Added a (draft) taxonomy of concepts used in the LEHD data world
      (label_concept_draft.csv)
    * Fixed the labeling of ownership code A00 to correctly reflect scope
    * Added files describing the number of quarters of data availability
      required relative to start and end quarters (lags_qwi.csv and
      lags_j2j.csv), and its metadata (variables_lags.csv)
