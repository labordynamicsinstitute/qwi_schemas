[IMPORTANT]
.Important
==============================================
This document is not an official Census Bureau publication. It is compiled from publicly accessible information
by Lars Vilhuber (http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/ldi/[Labor Dynamics Institute, Cornell University]).
Feedback is welcome. Please write us at
link:mailto:lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu?subject=LEHD_Schema_v4[lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu].
==============================================
	

Purpose
-------
The public-use data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program, including the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI)
and Job-to-Job Flows (J2J), are available for download with the following data schema.
These data are available  through the LEHD websiteâ€™s Data page at
http://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/ and through the LED Extraction Tool at http://ledextract.ces.census.gov/.

This document describes the data schema for LEHD files. LEHD-provided SHP files are separately described in link:lehd_shapefiles{ext-relative}[]. For each variable,
a set of allowable values is defined. Definitions are provided as CSV files,
with header variable definitions.  Changes relative to the original v4.0 version are listed <<changes,at the end>>.

File naming
-----------
The naming conventions of the data files is documented in link:lehd_csv_naming{ext-relative}[].

Extends
-------
This version reimplements some features from  V4.0. Many files compliant with LEHD or QWI Schema v4.0 will also be compliant with this schema, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

Supersedes
----------
This version supersedes V4.1.0, for files released as of R2017Q1.

Basic Schema
------------
Each data file is structured as a CSV file. The first columns contain <<identifiers>>, subsequent columns contain <<indicators>>, followed by <<statusflags,status flags>>. In some cases, visually formatted Excel (XLSX) files are also available,  containing the same information together with header lines  on each sheet.

=== Generic structure

[width="30%",format="csv",cols="<2",options="header"]
|===================================================
Column name
[ Identifier1 ]
[ Identifier2 ]
[ Identifier3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Indicator 1 ]
[ Indicator 2 ]
[ Indicator 3 ]
[ ... ]
[ Status Flag 1 ]
[ Status Flag 2 ]
[ Status Flag 3 ]
[ ... ]
|===================================================

Note: A full list of indicators for each type of file are shown below in the <<indicators,Indicators>> section.
While all indicators are included in the CSV files, only the requested indicators
will be included in data outputs from the LED Extraction Tool.

<<<

=== [[identifiers]]Identifiers
Records, unless otherwise noted, are parts of time-series data. Unique record identifiers are noted below, by file type.
Identifiers without the year and quarter component can be considered a series identifier.

==== Mapping for Identifiers
( link:lehd_mapping_identifiers.csv[] )

Each of the released files has a set of variables uniquely identifying records ('Identifiers'). The table below relates the set of identifier specifications
to the released files. The actual CSV files containing the identifiers for each set are listed after this table. Each identifier can take on a specified list of values, documented in the section on <<catvars,Categorical Variables>>.

=== [[indicators]]Indicators
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the indicators available on each file.  The descriptor files themselves are structured as follows:

- The ''Indicator Variable'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files, suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications.
- When given, the ''Alternate name'' may appear in related documentation and articles.
- The ''Status Flag'' is used to indicate publication or data quality status (see <<statusflags,Status Flags>>).
- The ''Indicator Name'' is a non-abbreviated version of the ''Indicator Variable''.
- The ''Description'' provides more verbose description of the variable.
- ''Units'' identify the type of variable according to a very simplified taxonomoy (not formalized yet): counts, rates, monetary amounts.
- ''Concept'' classifies the variables into higher-level concepts. The taxonomy for these concepts has not been finalized yet, see link:label_concept_draft.csv[label_concept_draft.csv] for a draft version.
- The ''Base'' indicates the denominator used to compute the statistic, and may be '1'.

=== [[vmeasures]]Variability measures
The following tables and associated mapping files
list the variability measures available on each file.  The ''Variability Measure'' is the short name of the variable on the CSV files,
suitable for machine processing in a wide variety of statistical applications. When given, the ''Alternate Name'' may appear in related documentation and articles.
The ''Variable Name'' is a more verbose description of the variability measure.

Six variability measures are published:

* Total variability, prefixed by vt_
* Standard error, prefixed by st_, and computed as the square root of Total Variability
* Between-implicate variability, prefixed by vb_
* Average within-implicate variability, prefixed by vw_
* Degrees of freedom, prefixed by df_
* Missingness ratio, prefixed by mr_

A missing variability measure indicates a structural zero in the corresponding indicator. This is currently not associated with a flag.

//Not all indicators have associated variability measures. For more details, see the following document TBD.

=== Aggregation level
( link:label_agg_level.csv[] )

Measures within the J2J and QWI data products are tabulated on many different dimensions, including demographic characteristics, geography, industry, and other firm characteristics. For Origin-Destination (O-D) tables, characteristics of the origin and destination firm can be tabulated separately.  Every tabulation level is assigned a unique aggregation index, represented by the agg_level variable. This index starts from 1, representing a national level grand total (all industries, workers, etc.), and progresses through different combinations of characteristics. There are gaps in the progression to leave space for aggregation levels that may be included in future data releases.

*agg_level* is currently  reported only for  J2J data products.


The following variables are included in the link:label_agg_level.csv[label_agg_level.csv]   file:

[width="60%",format="csv",cols="<2,<5",options="header"]
|===================================================
include::variables_agg_level.csv[]
|===================================================


The characteristics available on an aggregation level are repeated using a series of flags following the standard schema:

- <<geolevel,geo_level>> - geographic level of table
- <<ind_level,ind_level>> - industry level of table
- by_ variables - flags indicating other dimensions reported, including ownership, demographics, firm age and size.

A shortened representation of the file is provided below, the complete file is available in the link above.

Each status flag in the tables above contains one of the following valid values.
The values and their interpretation are listed in the table below.

==============================================
Note: Currently, the J2J tables only contain status flags '-1', '1', '5'. Status flags with values 10 or above only appear in online applications, not in CSV files.

== [[metadata]]Metadata
( link:variables_version.csv[] )

=== [[metadataqwij2j]]Version Metadata for QWI and J2J Files (version.txt)

Each data release is accompanied by one or more files with metadata on geographic and temporal coverage, in a compact notation. These files follow the following naming convention:
--------------------------------
version_[demo]_[fas].txt
version_[type].txt
--------------------------------
where each component is described in more detail in link:lehd_csv_naming{ext-relative}[].

The contents contains the following elements:
[width="90%",format="csv",cols="<1,<2,<5",options="header"]
|===================================================
include::tmp_variables_version.csv[]
|===================================================

For instance, the metadata for the R2017Q3 release of
Missouri QWI
Sex by Age tabulations
for No firm size or age detail
(obtained from https://lehd.ces.census.gov/pub/mo/R2017Q3/DVD-sa_f//version_sa_f.txt[here]) has  the following content:
--------------------------------
QWISA_F MO 29 1995:1-2016:4 V4.1.2 R2017Q3 qwipu_mo_20170928_1714
--------------------------------
Similarly, the metadata for the R2017Q3 release of
Missouri J2J
tabulations (obtained from https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/j2j/R2017Q3/j2j/mo//version_j2j.txt[here]) has  the following content:
--------------------------------
J2J MO 29 2000:2-2016:3 V4.2b-draft R2017Q3 j2jpu_mo_20171023_1412
--------------------------------
Some J2J metadata may contain multiple lines, as necessary.

=== [[metadataj2jod]]Additional Metadata for J2JOD Files (avail.csv)
(link:variables_avail.csv[])

Because the origin-destination (J2JOD) data link two regions, we provide an auxiliary file with the time range that cells containing data for each geographic pairing may appear in a data release.
[width="80%",format="csv",cols="<2,<2,<4",options="header"]
|===================================================
include::variables_avail.csv[]
|===================================================
The reference region will always be either the origin or the destination. National tabulations contain records where both origin and destination are <<geolevel,geo_level>>=N; state tabulations contain records where <<geolevel,geo_level>> in (N,S); metro tabulations contain records where <<geolevel,geo_level>> in (N,S,B). Data may be suppressed for certain combinations of regions and quarters because the estimates do not meet Census Bureau publication standards.



=== [[metadatalags]]Metadata on Indicator Availability
(link:variables_lags.csv[])

Each <<indicators,Indicator>> potentially requires leads and/or lags of data to be computed, and thus may not be available for certain time periods. Only two QWI will be available for all quarters of the time span described by +start+ and +end+ in the <<metadataqwij2j,version.txt>> files:  +EmpTotal+ and +Payroll+.  The date range for QWI, QWIR, J2J, and J2JR can be found in <<metadataqwij2j,version.txt>>; the date range for J2JOD can be found in <<metadataj2jod,avail.csv>>.

For each indicator, the following files contain the quarters of data required to be available relative to the overall date range described in the metadata for the release:

* link:lags_qwi.csv[]
* link:lags_j2j.csv[]
* link:lags_j2japp.csv[]

The files are structured as follows:
